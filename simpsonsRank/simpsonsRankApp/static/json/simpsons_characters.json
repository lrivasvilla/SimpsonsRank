He is Homer Simpson's best friend, although to a lesser extent after high school. Being a frequent customer at Moe's (to the point of sleeping there) Barney considers Moe to be his second best friend; however, he is often abused by Moe in the process, mainly due to Moe's personality. Barney was formerly an A-student back at Springfield High, but lost it all due to his drinking alcohol. When he sings, he has a very nice voice. This talent was discovered by the Be Sharps when Barney was in the men's restroom."

    "description": "Helen Lovejoy (née Schwartzbaum) is Reverend Timothy Lovejoy's judgmental and gossipy wife and the mother of Jessica Lovejoy. It is hinted that she is the godmother of Lisa and Bart Simpson. Though she can be rude at times, she is very kind to the people she loves and is almost always seen when we see the people of Springfield doing charity or community service. Helen can behave mean and gossipy and is part of a bowling team called The Holly Rollers with members Ned Flanders and Timothy Lovejoy Jr. and ex-member Maude Flanders (deceased) and (most likely) the leader of the Fleet-a-Pita club called the Investorettes with members Agnes Skinner, Luann Van Houten and ex-members Edna Krabappel (deceased), Maude Flanders (deceased) and Marge Simpson, whom the club kicked out in \"The Twisted World Of Marge Simpson\". Helen was often partnered with Maude Flanders as they protested against the \"evils\" in Springfield. Her first line was in \"Life on The Fast Lane\" and it was \"Marge? Marge Simpson. You remember me, don't you? I'm Helen Lovejoy the gossipy wife of the Minister.\" Her catchphrase, “Won't somebody please think of the children?\" is used quite often but sometimes, they replace the word \"children\" with a different word like in \"Thanksgiving of Horror\", she says \"The Pilgrims! Won't somebody please think of the Pilgrims?\". Also, in \"Pulpit Friction\", she says \"Why won't somebody blame the children?”. Whenever Ned calls Reverend Lovejoy she says her second catchphrase, “Ned Flanders is on the phone.\""

Kang and Kodos have a lot of space weaponry on hand and have their own spaceship. They speak the Rigellian language, which, by coincidence, is identical to English. Although they look identical, Kang has a deeper voice than Kodos. He is the featured character on the on the Season 14 DVD/Blu-ray box set as well as the iTunes cover.  According to Kang on the Jerry Springer show, his hearing was advanced enough that not even being confined to a soundproof room was enough to mute out Homer and Springer's conversation before being formally introduced on stage."

He was the stuntman for Fallout Boy when the Radioactive Man movie was being produced in Springfield. In a ploy by Mr. Burns to fool Bart, he played Lisa, eventually teaching her many things about his native land of Estonia. The Estonian Dwarf also is a popular Meme. Also known to argue in a loop with Jose. Can't tell the difference between bit and byte."

He played a character that threatened to steal all of the Holiday cheer of the Winter Holidays in the Krusty’s Kristmas On Ice show. When a fight broke out between the basketball team and the show skaters (because the preparations for the upcoming game were ruining the show) Homer took matters to his own hands and fought the Grumple, demanding that he return the Holiday cheer. On Christmas Day, when Gil had all of his stuff stacked in the living room of the Simpsons House, Homer commented that this was a problem. Marge then commented that Homer had a bigger problem outside and pointed at the window. The Grumple was standing outside the house, holding a knife and proclaiming \"Grumpily Grumpily Groo! Your blood will make my stew!\" Homer suspects it was the same Grumple from the Ice Show. Sometime later in the year, while Gil was still mooching off the Simpsons, Homer was at Moe's Tavern and the Grumple attempted to attack again with a broken pool stick. Homer hit him with a beer bottle, knocking him unconscious, suddenly, some sort of green liquid began oozing out of the Grumple's eye, suggesting that it was not a human in a costume, but some sort of strange creature. The Grumple does not return until the following Christmas when the Simpson Family spend it at their condo in Scottsdale, Arizona with Gil, having brought his wife, son and daughter with him. The Grumple proclaims \"Grumpily-grumpily-groo, we're here to share Christmas with you!\" having put his feud with Homer aside as the humans and Grumples began singing Christmas Carols."

She reflected some of her views during her husband's presidency, particularly when Bush Sr. was known for making the remark that \"America needs to be a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons\". Barbara Bush had taken a softer stance to The Simpsons, saying that she would have enjoyed inviting Marge Simpson to a dinner at the White House if it was physically possible. She is shocked that when the Simpsons are touring the White House they feel entitled to go into the private quarters of the presidential family and that they see her in the bathtub. Despite being rightfully annoyed at first, Mrs. Bush softens her tone when she sees the Simpsons are wearing VIP badges. Later, Barbara Bush is much more courteous, making friends with Marge and she gets along quite well with Bart Simpson, despite the fact that Bart is a nuisance to her husband. Both Marge and Barbara are annoyed by the fact their husbands bicker and eventually fight, agreeing that both men act in a pig-headed manner."

His character has been described as \"balder than Siskel and fatter than Ebert\". His appearance in \"A Star is Burns\" was a crossover to promote the second season of The Critic, which made its FOX debut on the same day after the episode premiered. The Critic was later canceled.

Although he got through the stunt itself in one piece, he ended up clumsily falling in while basking in the glory afterward, swimming to the edge only to be pulled back in by a lion, and had to be netted out by paramedics and put on a stretcher, barely surviving. He inspired Bart Simpson to become a daredevil and convinced him personally to jump over Springfield Gorge on a skateboard. After Homer ended up hospitalized after he had inadvertently jumped the gorge in Bart's place in an attempt to stop him (as well as falling down the gorge again due to the ambulance driving into a tree), he ended up being the neighboring patient of Lance Murdock, with Homer bitterly telling him \"You think you've got guts?

Dr. Velimirovic tells Marge that she has to wait at least 48-hours before the implants can be safely removed. Marge is at first furious about the mix-up, but later becomes adjusted to them. In the end, however, she decides to have them removed."

Professor Frink suggests her likeness was spotted \"on the grassy knoll\" 137 - 200 frames prior to Kennedy's fatal asassination in the Zapruder film. \nHomer watched him on TV when he was a boy.\nGrampa found out he was sympathetic to the Nazis and had him beaten up when he overheard him say, \"Ich bin ein Berliner.\"\nHe also appeared in Lisa's dream, where Lisa said that she would see him in Heaven, though he then went to Hell laughing after awkwardly acknowledging Heaven in response. He also may have been the president alluded to by Steve in Secret Nuclear Defense Plan U.S. Govt. Film #1612 due to the monochrome display suggesting a time frame between the late 1940s and early 1960s, although the lack of a mention to a specific time frame for the film does not make this clear. After falling into a nuclear bunker in Gone Boy, Bart watched  the real, non-animated Kennedy First Inauguration Speech and mocked it by sarcastically saying \"Doesn't sound like any President I know.\" He is voiced in exactly the same way as Joe Quimby."

Vidal first attempted to poison Abe's dentures, but that failed, and later, he disguised himself as Homer Simpson (badly), with Burns dressed as Marge and Smithers dressed as Bart, and tried to throw a knife at Abe. His final attempt, which he claimed to be his most ingenious, involved simply bursting into the retirement home armed with a machine gun and shooting the place up, however he was driven away when one of the nurses pulled out a shotgun and fired at him for disturbing the residents. He is also apparently a part-time drug dealer as he mistakes Mr. Burns' initials for former D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, who was arrested by the FBI on drug charges."
